In the last post, [&#8220;Why do you do What you do? The Practice of Personal Productivity&#8221;][1], we discussed the importance of motivation and managing our inner work life in being productive. Now let&#8217;s focus on the set of principles for personal productivity I have found useful in getting things done and use as the basis for my personal productivity system.

There are many benefits to using a system or methodology including:

1.  Reducing our anxiety
2.  Increasing our ability to keep commitments
3.  Increasing our accomplishment and associated blessing
4.  Increasing your effectiveness (not just your efficiency)

For fun, I have turned my set of 10 principles into movie posters.

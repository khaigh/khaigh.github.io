On October 22nd, I presented two sessions at <a href="http://www.barcampchs.org/" title="BarCampCHS" target="_blank">BarCamp Charleston</a> and had a great time. The first session was an &#8220;Introduction to node.js and socket.io.&#8221; The second session was on &#8220;Personal Productivity: Using Agile and Lean to Get Stuff Done.&#8221; I have uploaded my personal productivity slides here. Enjoy!

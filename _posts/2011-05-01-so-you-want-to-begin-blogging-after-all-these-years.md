I have decided to join the millennium and create this blog. Although blogging is a long term goal of mine, a number of reasons kept me from starting. I never believed I could commit to regular posting based on my commitments at home and work. I am also a private person and find it uncomfortable sharing my thoughts with a larger audience.

My reasons for creating this blog:

*   **Experience.** I have some now. I have learned a number of hard lessons from seventeen years of marriage, raising three children, and leading others. As a result, I do not take myself as seriously, learned the importance of charity towards others, and developed a perspective in which I view the world. I plan to take that experience and world view and provide thought leadership through this blog.
*   **Encouragement from Others**. I regularly meet one on one with others to provide feedback, advice, and mentorship. Many have encouraged me to share that advice in a larger forum.
*   **Continued Growth.** I still have plenty of room to grow. I believe this growth will occur as I am forced to clearly articulate viewpoints, interact with others, and move out of my comfort zone. I look forward to improving my writing skills as many will go out of their way to point out my typos.
*   **Giving Back.** Over the years, I have taken more than I have received from global internet community going back to the days of Usenet. The experience of others has made my job easier and helped me develop personally and in my career. It is time to give back to that community. I hope to provide a timeless perspective instead of recycling the latest content.

My goal is to create 50 posts over the next year (approximately 1 per week). I plan to spend 1 &#8211; 1 1/2 hours per week in writing the content and 1/2 hour per week brainstorming topics.

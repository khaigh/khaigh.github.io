In the [last leadership post][1], we discussed the importance of wisdom, learning, and understanding in demonstrating competence as a leader and influencer of others. This week, we will continue to look at the characteristics of a competent leader.

Good leaders exercise self-control. Exercising self-control involves managing one&#8217;s emotions and impulses in order to control inappropriate reactions and channel energy in a positive manner.

**Why it Matters**

Self-control enables good leaders to stay calm and clear-headed during a crisis or a time of high stress. A leader with self-control can also act strategically instead of just reacting. Self-control enables leaders to resist short term gain at the expense of a bigger long term payout.

**A Lack of Control**

What does a lack of control in a leader look like? Expressing anger is a common reaction. Instead of demonstrating leadership, some will act out like a two year old child throwing a public temper tantrum. This behavior creates havoc and stress in an organization, a loss of team productivity, and causes a leader to lose influence over others.

For others like me, a more common reaction is impatience and irritability. The symptoms of impatience and irritability include interrupting others, expressing a grumpy disposition, a lack of listening, and put downs. This negative behavior can become contagious in an organization.

Finally, a lack of control can cause a leader to act on impulse. Unchecked over time, this can lead to excessive greed and addiction and ultimately to moral failure.

**How to Improve Self-Control**

* **Avoidance** &#8211; Recognize the times when your self-control is low and avoid the temptation during those times. For me, my self-control is at its lowest when I am tired. Often solitude and rest are needed to fill back up my tank.
* **Realization** &#8211; Reflect and realize the true value of whatever is tempting you. When you devalue your temptations, realize the consequences of acting, and see the value of longer term goals, you are more likely to orient yourself towards those goals and avoid temptation altogether.
* **Pre-commitment** &#8211; Make important decisions before you are in a tempting situation. Setting goals for yourself can keep you going when you are tempted to give up. Also, knowing your walk-away point is important to avoid later regret during a negotiation. The key is to reduce the number of options you have in the future. When the ancient Greek armies would land upon an enemy&#8217;s shore, the first command was to &#8220;burn the boats&#8221; in order to ensure the warriors were committed to victory.

**What about you? I would like to hear what helps you exercise self-control. You can leave a comment below.**

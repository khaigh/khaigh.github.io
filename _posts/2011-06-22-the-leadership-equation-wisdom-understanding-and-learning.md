In the [previous post][1], we finished discussing the characteristics of a leader that enable trust in others. We will now look at the characteristics of a competent leader.

Wisdom is hard to define. The reason is that wisdom is difficult to quantify and it is elusive. We know it when we see it, though. Philosophers (lovers of wisdom) and authors over the ages have contributed their own interpretations. I don&#8217;t claim authority in my definition or have the space in this blog to produce a volume on wisdom.

So for our purposes, we will define wisdom as
> the ability to select the best course of action according to what is true or right (values); through discernment and realization of people, things, events, and situations (understanding); with respect to past experiences and acquired knowledge (learning).

**Why Wisdom Matters for a Leader**

If you are leading others, the implication is that there is a destination. Wisdom is the key characteristic for a leader to plot a correct course of action to arrive at the desired destination. People without wisdom lack the competence to effectively lead. Ineffective leaders make decisions not based on wisdom but on self-interest, prejudgments, attachment, and an over-reliance on one aspect of wisdom such as past experience or some new knowledge (e.g. fad).

**The Impact of Folly**

Folly is the opposite of wisdom. The impact of folly includes:

* **Loss of time and resources** &#8211; Making wrong decisions often cost an organization time and money. Correcting the course of action can become costly and usually comes at the expense of others. This often leads to lower morale when others are required to work harder and longer to make up ground.
* **Placing an organization at risk** &#8211; A poor business decision could end an organization. There are too many organization to list that ended as a a result of a poor decision or series of poor decisions. One could argue that we need to look no further than the latest economic meltdown and crisis. The meltdown occurred as a result of the folly of a handful of key decision-makers.

**I would like to hear from others on how a person obtains wisdom.** Iâ€™ll start with that it is a process and one must greatly value wisdom. I look forward to seeing what you share.

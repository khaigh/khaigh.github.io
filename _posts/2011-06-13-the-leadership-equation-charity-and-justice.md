Good leaders are just and charitable towards others. Words like &#8220;charity&#8221; and &#8220;justice&#8221; have lost their meaning in this [day and age][1]. For a leader, being just (guided by truth, reason, and fairness) and charitable (kind-hearted, the opposite of a critical spirit) are important characteristics in gaining the trust of others.

Let&#8217;s take a look at why justice and charity matter.

<!--more-->

**Just and Fair**

Good leaders demonstrate fairness in evaluation of situations and people. They spend time gathering information and deliberating before passing judgement. When good leaders exist in an organization, people are rewarded/promoted based on their contribution instead of who they know or a leader&#8217;s mood. Based on gathered facts and contextual understanding, good leaders are not afraid to give feedback and correct performance when necessary.

The impact of injustice in an organization is decreased morale, higher turnover, and lower team productivity. Others are unlikely to follow someone when they are treated unfairly.

**The Judgement of Charity**

Good leaders practice the judgement of charity. The judgement of charity favors best-case analysis over worst-case analysis. To illustrate, when all the facts have been gathered, a person&#8217;s intentions or motives are often still unknown. The worst-case analysis assumes the worst of motives and that a person&#8217;s intention was based on self-interest, revenge, or blame shifting. Avoiding the worst-case analysis becomes even more difficult when we are the ones hurt or offended in a situation.

The best-case analysis, however, gives the benefit of the doubt. The best-case analysis assumes the best possible motives of another. When a good leader practices the judgement of charity, they follow the golden rule: &#8220;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&#8221; We should judge others in the best possible light as we expect others to judge us.

The impact of charity in a organization is a reduction in the escalation of words and actions. As a result, less conflict and hostility exists. Others are unlikely to follow someone when they are continually misunderstood.

**Summary**

We have looked at integrity, truthfulness, faithfulness, humility, servanthood, charity, and justice. All these characteristics enable a leader to gain the trust of others. In the next post, we will start the discussion of the characteristics that help a leader demonstrate competence.

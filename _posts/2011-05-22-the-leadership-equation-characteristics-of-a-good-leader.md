There is no shortage of content written on leadership. A quick google search or visit to Amazon reveals many opinions on traits, qualities, and definitions of leadership. Why contribute yet another series of articles on such a popular topic? Good leaders are in short supply. I believe the popularity of the topic is a result of the continual leadership failures revealed each week in the news.

Everyone can lead, though some should not. Being a good leader is hard and requires the right set of talent, skill, and character. Do you have what it takes to lead others?

**Leader â‰  Manager**

Often people will use leader and manager interchangeably. Some individuals are both a leader and manager. However there is a clear difference between the two.

A manager is a steward or administrator of an organization&#8217;s resources and/or people. A manager is given authority to make things happen. Managers exercise authority over others. People are required to follow managers.

A leader is an influencer of others. A leader does not force others to make things happen. A leader inspires. People choose to follow leaders.

You don&#8217;t have to manage others to be a leader in your organization. Leaders can exist in all roles within the organization regardless of position. Personally, I am cast in both a leader and manager role at my company, though I prefer to motivate others as a leader.

**How Does a Leader Influence Others?**

Good leaders maximize their influence of others. This influence is simply the product of trust, competence, and vision, although this influence is hard to achieve. Over the next 9 posts, I will unpack trust, competence, and vision, and discuss 15 characteristics of a good leader.

**Take a look at the equation above. Can anyone make a guess at the variables?** (Hint: each variable/numerator is the first letter of one of the characteristics.)

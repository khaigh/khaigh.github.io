If somehow you haven&#8217;t heard already, Google launched Google+, their answer to Facebook.  Google+ is not yet available for all users.  For the last couple of days, I have been greeted by a message stating that they have &#8220;temporarily exceeded their capacity&#8217; while trying to join.  However, persistence has paid off and I am finally in.  If you are in the same boat, keep trying.  Google+ is adding users each day.

Here are my first impressions:

The interface is very clean in comparison Facebook.  They have also introduced some social concepts:

**Circles** is the place to add friends.  You can create various custom groups by dragging people&#8217;s names into a circle such as Family, Acquaintances, and Friends.  This makes is easier to categorize your relationships.

**Sparks** allows you to create a category to &#8216;share&#8217; on selected circles.  This is handy if you only what to share your location to certain selected circles.

**Hangouts** enables video chats with friends and sharing of videos.

The only problem I see right now is that I have no friends.  Let me know if you are interested in joining by leaving a comment below.   I will do my best to process invites this weekend.   If you are already on Google+, add me to your circle.

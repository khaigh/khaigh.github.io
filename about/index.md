### My Biography

I started writing code on my Apple II Plus in the fifth grade and have worked at software companies my entire career. I earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science from Clemson University and a Master of Science from Georgia Tech.

My career started as a Software Engineer for Lotus Development Corporation where I worked on the team that developed Ami Pro (later Word Pro), a great word processor. During the late nineties, I transitioned to a startup company located in Atlanta called Synchrologic, Inc. We created a mobile server platform that synchronized people&#8217;s email, calendars, and data for many different devices. After the company was purchased by Nokia, I moved to Charleston to work for Blackbaud, the leading provider of software and solutions for non-profit organizations. There I served as the Director of Software Development leading an 85-person staff responsible for the design, engineering, and quality-assurance activities for multiple products, including Blackbaud Enterprise CRM and The Raiser&#8217;s Edge.

When I joined PeopleMatter, I served as the Senior Vice President of Technology and was responsible for the overall design and development of the PeopleMatter products. Now as PeopleMatter&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer, I am responsible for driving PeopleMatter&#8217;s day-to-day-operations, as well as, aligning PeopleMatter&#8217;s resources effectively, and ensuring tight coordination across products, services, solutions, and architectures.

I have been married to my wife, Susan, for seventeen years though we have been friends for twenty-six years. Susan and I have three wonderful children. I am also a member of Eastbridge Presbyterian Church and follower of Jesus Christ.
